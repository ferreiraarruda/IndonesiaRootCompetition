## Scripts
There are only two scripts written in RMarkdown
- "exploratory_preliminary" is just me checnking out the data and trying out a few things
- "pcas" is the one where I used more up to date data and included the new Nitrogen data and mergerd the tra and abs roots, so this is the more interesting one

## DATA
For the analyses I have done so far, I have only used the "pairs_traits" file and the "nitro" file. 
- "pairs_traits" was derived from the B11_root_trait..." file.
- "nitro" is just how I got the data from the techs
- "sumatra_ids_thalita" is just the ids of the samples to were analyzed for Nitro
