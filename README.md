## Scripts
There are only two scripts written in RMarkdown:
- **"exploratory_preliminary"** is just me checking out the data and trying out a few things.
- **"pcas"** is the one where I used more up-to-date data and included the new Nitrogen data and merged the tra and abs roots, so this is the more interesting one.

## DATA
For the analyses I have done so far, I have only used the **"pairs_traits"** file and the **"nitro"** file.  
- **"pairs_traits"** was derived from the **"B11_root_trait..."** file.  
- **"nitro"** is just how I got the data from the techs.  
- **"sumatra_ids_thalita"** is just the IDs of the samples that were analyzed for Nitro.  

## Figures
All the figures in the **"figures"** folder were produced in the **"pcas"** script. The way they are at the moment is with inverted colors, so I could use them in the dark background presentation. If you re-run the **"pcas"** script, they will be saved with the standard colors.
